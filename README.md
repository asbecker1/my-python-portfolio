SEMESTER 1

Project #1: Digital Scene
I made a picnic that contained trees in the backround that had 3 different color options. I also made a sky with clouds and a sun. In addition, it had a picnic blanket with a picnic basket and some bread and waterbottles. 

Project #2: Rock Paper Scissors
For this project, it asked the user to chose between rock paper and scissors. Then, the computer randomly generates one of the options and it determines who won the game. It keeps track of the number of wins, loses, and ties that the user had. 

Project #3: Name Generator
For this project, I made a snack generator. This meant I created different questions to determine which snack the user was. I used if statements to make it have muliple different questions and each pathway ended with a yummy snack. 

Project #4: MadLibs
For this project, I started by asking the user for random parts of speech. For example, I would ask the user for a noun and an adjective. I then put these parts of speech into a premade story. 

Project #5: Number Guesser
For this project, I made a code that would have the computer generate a random number and then had the user guess a random number. It keeps track of how many each person got wrong. 

SEMESTER 2

Project #6: Create Task
For this project, I made a code that would take user input and give the user a food they should eat bases. The user puts in the meal the want, then the program changes the filtered list to only include the type of food they want. Then they randomly generates a number and then it has an if statement that determines which number is correlated to which food. 

Project #7: Magic8Ball
For this project, I made a code that asks the user to put in a yes or no question. If the question has a "?" than it responds and gives a random response using a random number generator.
