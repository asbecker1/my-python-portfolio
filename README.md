This repository contains the best work of my semester 1 in Ap computer science. 

Project #1: Digital Scene
I made a picnic that contained trees in the backround that had 3 different color options. I also made a sky with clouds and a sun. In addition, it had a picnic blanket with a picnic basket and some bread and waterbottles. 

Project #2: Rock Paper Scissors
For this project, it asked the user to chose between rock paper and scissors. Then, the computer randomly generates one of the options and it determines who won the game. It keeps track of the number of wins, loses, and ties that the user had. 

Project #3: Name Generator
For this project, I made a snack generator. This meant I created different questions to determine which snack the user was. I used if statements to make it have muliple different questions and each pathway ended with a yummy snack. 

Project #4: MadLibs
For this project, I started by asking the user for random parts of speech. For example, I would ask the user for a noun and an adjective. I then put these parts of speech into a premade story. 

Project #5: Number Guesser
For this project, I made a code that would have the computer generate a random number and then had the user guess a random number. It keeps track of how many each person got wrong.
